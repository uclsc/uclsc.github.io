description: All the books you can borrow
---

Members of Upstate Coders League can offer to lend books to other members. This is a system built on trust. Members offer books they own, and other members can borrow them. The books are not owned by the Upstate Coders League, but by the members who offer them. Books should be traded during our meetups.

We try to offer books that you may not be able to find at a local library. We also recommend that you check your local library first, as they may have the books you are looking for.

### Want to offer books?

Before you want to offer books, make sure to come to the meetup and get to know us! We want to make it so members know each other and feel comfortable borrowing books from each other. 

Then, proceed to make a PR on the books page to add your books.
