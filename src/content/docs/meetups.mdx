<Aside type="tip">
*What is the meetup experience like?* We're aiming to make the meetups as laid back as possible. It's not a conference, there are no talks, it's just folks hanging out with friends over a beverage and snacks.

You'll find the group huddled at a table or two of whatever venue we're at.
